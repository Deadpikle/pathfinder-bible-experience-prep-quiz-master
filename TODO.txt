TODO:
-need to test uploading csv but the code is there
-refactor use of $_SESSION['PreferredLanguageID'] to User class
    -and other session items
-Refactor settings to an actual class
-Refactor more things to PBEAppConfig

Eventual:
-Revamp UI everywhere
    *-Switch to Bootstrap 5
    *-Use select2 for searchable dropdowns
    *-Use breadcrumbs
    -Use Bootstrap 5 toast messages on matching quiz rather than `alert`
-the language translation definitely is in need of better code/upgrades
    -need to show copyright multi-language if there are multiple languages of questions showing up (e.g. user has site in spanish but loads english questions)
