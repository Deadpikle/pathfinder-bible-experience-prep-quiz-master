TODO:
-user facing pages
    -get quiz me page working (and associated quiz pages)
        -setup page probably works, but need to get quiz page and study guide PDF pages working/refactored
        -PDF output (again, needs variables rather than $_POST array)
        -save answers
        -flag question
    -double check to see if we are properly loading whether a question is flagged by a user or not
-admin facing pages (everything...)
    -use Twig and datatables for better admin display
    -need to test that study guide uploads work and show up on study guide page when done with admin side of things
-refactor use of $_SESSION['PreferredLanguageID'] to User class
    -and other session items
-Refactor settings to an actual class
-Refactor more things to PBEAppConfig

-This would be a _great_ opportunity to make this website UTF-8 compatible
    -https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/104866 for a script -- could probably work this into a migration...?

Eventual:
-Switch to Bootstrap 3 or 4
-Revamp UI everywhere
-Use select2 for searchable dropdowns
-Use breadcrumbs
