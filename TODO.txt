TODO:
-user facing pages
    -double check to see if we are properly loading whether a question is flagged by a user or not
    -I think this is done, but needs testing (esp. flagging and saving answers)
-admin facing pages (everything...)
    -use Twig (working as of 3 May) and datatables for better admin display
    -need to test uploading csv but the code is there
    -items remaining:
        -home page info
    -validation for admin only vs conference only vs club only admin sections (currently conference admins who know URL can get to other admin items!!!)
        -see SettingsController
-convert user pages to twig?
-refactor use of $_SESSION['PreferredLanguageID'] to User class
    -and other session items
-Refactor settings to an actual class
-Refactor more things to PBEAppConfig

-This would be a _great_ opportunity to make this website UTF-8 compatible
    -https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/104866 for a script -- could probably work this into a migration...?

Eventual:
-Revamp UI everywhere
    -Switch to Bootstrap 4
    -Use select2 for searchable dropdowns
    -Use breadcrumbs
