TODO:
-need to test uploading csv but the code is there
-refactor use of $_SESSION['PreferredLanguageID'] to User class
    -and other session items
-Refactor settings to an actual class
-Refactor more things to PBEAppConfig

-This would be a _great_ opportunity to make this website UTF-8 compatible
    -https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/104866 for a script -- could probably work this into a migration...?
    -ok i edited old migrations, but might need mb_* functions and other fixes. pdfs need UTF8 compat anyway.

Eventual:
-Revamp UI everywhere
    -Switch to Bootstrap 4!!!
    -Use select2 for searchable dropdowns
    -Use breadcrumbs
