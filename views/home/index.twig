            <ul class="">
                <li>The PBE website has been given a new facelift! Things will still be in generally the same place as before, but they will run a little bit more smoothly and look a bit more modern. You'll also see icons in various places to help you distinguish buttons by more than text. Behind the scenes, many smaller bugs and issues have been fixed, and things are easier to update and change for the website maintainers.</li>
                <li>New feature: this website now has a dark mode (light text on a dark background rather than the other way around). You can opt-in to this website style via the Settings page.</li>
