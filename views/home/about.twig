            <p>The {{ app.websiteName }} website was originally developed for <a href="https://www.clubministries.org/pathfinders/">Pathfinder</a> clubs in the <a href="https://www.uccsda.org/">Upper Columbia Conference</a> of <a href="https://www.adventist.org/en/">Seventh-day Adventists</a>. It was created by and is now hosted by <a href="https://babien.co/" target="_blank">Michael Babienco</a>, an alumnus of Southern Adventist University.</p>
            <p>Once you've been given access to the website by a club, conference, or website administrator, you'll be able to take quizzes online or generate PDFs of question flash cards to take with you on the road. You can save which questions you've answered correctly so you don't see those questions again, view stats on how you're doing during a quiz, use this website on your tablet or phone as well as on desktop, generate quizzes with weighted (or random!) question distribution, and more!</p>
            <p>For some sample quizzes that you can generate when using this website, view the following samples:
