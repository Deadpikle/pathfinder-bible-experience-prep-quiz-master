            <p class="flow-text">The new {{ app.websiteName }} website was originally developed for <a href="http://www.pathfindersonline.org/">Pathfinder</a> clubs in the <a href="https://www.uccsda.org/">Upper Columbia Conference</a> of <a href="https://www.adventist.org/en/">Seventh-day Adventists</a>. It was created by and is now hosted by <a href="babien.co" target="_blank">Michael Babienco</a>, an alumnus of Southern Adventist University.</p>
            <p>This website costs the creator approximately $50/year to host, not including time to maintain and update features. If you and your Pathfinder club are willing to donate a few dollars towards the cost of hosting this website, please email Michael Babienco, website creator, at <a href="mailto:michael@babienco">michael@babienco</a>. He'll send you a PayPal link or similar. <strong>This message will be removed when hosting costs have been covered for the current PBE year. Thank you for your help!</strong>
